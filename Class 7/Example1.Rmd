```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

smaller <- ggplot2::diamonds %>%
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(ggplot2::diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(ggplot2::diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01) + labs(y = "Frequency")
```

```{r}
2+2
```
