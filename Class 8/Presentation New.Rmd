## Introduction

- Originally airing in April 2009 in the mockumentary style of the acclaimed TV show "The Office," NBC's Parks and Recreation has become a popular streaming show in its own right.

\vskip 0.10 in

- The show follows the lives of a group of government employees working in the parks and recreation department of fictitious Indiana city, Pawnee.

\vskip 0.10 in

- The show stars Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, Aziz Ansari, Chris Pratt, and Aubrey Plaza, among others.

## Introduction

- Using the scripts from every episode, the goals of my analysis were to:

\vskip 0.10 in

1. Visually determine if differences may exist in the number of lines per episode my favorite character Ron Swanson says across the seasons.
2. Visually compare the average number of lines per episode per season Ron Swanson says.
3. Determine the top 25 words main character Leslie Knope says each season.

- \textit{\underline{Let's get started!!}}

## Ron Swanson - Number of Lines Per Episode Per Season

```{r,echo=F,include=F}

## Read in the Data ##

library(readxl)

pnr <- read_xlsx("Parks and Rec Scripts Dataset.xlsx")

## Data Integrity Check ##

pnr |>
  glimpse()

## Create Aggregated Dataset to Count Up Number of Lines 
## Ron Says Per Episode ##

ron_lines <- pnr |>
  filter(Character == 'Ron Swanson') |>
  group_by(Season,Episode) |>
  count() |>
  rename(`Number of Lines` = n)

ron_lines |>
  head()

## Create Side-by-Side Boxplot ##

p1 <- ron_lines |>
  mutate(Season = as.character(Season)) |>
  ggplot(aes(fill=Season,y=`Number of Lines`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Seasons",
       y = "Number of Lines",
       title = "Ron Swanson's Number of Lines Per Episode") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 25),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15))

```
```{r,echo=F}
p1
```

## Ron Swanson - Number of Lines Per Episode Per Season

- As we can see, Ron had the most lines in a given episode in season `r ron_lines$Season[which.max(ron_lines$"Number of Lines")] `.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Ron had the fewest number of lines in a given episode in season `r ron_lines$Season[which.min(ron_lines$"Number of Lines")] `.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Ron's average number of lines per episode was `r round(mean(ron_lines$"Number of Lines"),2) `.

## Ron Swanson - Average Number of Lines Per Episode Per Season

```{r,echo=F,include=F}
## Create Aggregated Dataset ##

ron_avg_lines <- ron_lines |>
  group_by(Season) |>
  summarize(`Average Number of Lines` = round(mean(`Number of Lines`),2))

ron_avg_lines |>
  head()

## Create Ordered, Horizontal Bar Chart ##

p2 <- ron_avg_lines |>
  mutate(Season = as.character(Season)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=`Average Number of Lines`,y=reorder(Season,`Average Number of Lines`),
             fill=Season)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  geom_text(aes(label=`Average Number of Lines`),color='white',hjust=1.5) +
  labs(y="Seasons",
       title="Ron's Average Number of Lines Per Season") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 25),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15))
```
```{r,echo=F}
p2
```

## Leslie Knope Word Clouds - Season params$Season

```{r,echo=F,include=T}
## Subset to just Leslie ##

leslie <- pnr |>
  filter(Character == "Leslie Knope")

## Subset to Season 1 ##

s1 <- leslie |>
  filter(Season == params$Season)

## Create Word Cloud for Season 1 ##

library(stringr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)

data("stop_words")

## Create Visualization ##

s1 |>
  select(Line) |>
  unnest_tokens(word,Line) |>
  anti_join(stop_words) |>
  filter(word != "yeah",
         word != "gonna") |>
  count(word) |>
  with(wordcloud(word,n,max.words=25))
```
