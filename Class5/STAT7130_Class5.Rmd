## Introduction

- We learned in the last class session about how to use \texttt{ggplot2} to create a few different types of graphs.

\vskip 0.10 in

- As mentioned, being able to describe data visually is an important skill as visuals are often quite effective at describing data to a variety of audiences.

\vskip 0.10 in

- In this class, we will build upon what we went over last week to show how \texttt{ggplot2} can be used to create effective graphs in common data situations.

## Labels

- Obviously, it is quite a difficult task for a graph to "stand alone" if there are not descriptive axis titles or a descriptive main title.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ex <- rexp(100)
hist(ex,xlab="",ylab="",main="")
```

## Labels 

- We already saw last week how to add axis/main labels using the \texttt{labs()} function. Let's review the fuel efficiency data that we were working with last week.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = paste("Fuel efficiency generally decreases",
    "with engine size",sep=" "))
```

## Labels 

```{r}
p
```


## Labels

- A good title is pretty useful for communicating the main finding or takeaway from the graph.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Occassionally, we may need to add more labels to provide additional information. For example, maybe a subtitle with another insight or a footnote with the data source.

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = paste("Fuel efficiency generally decreases",
    "with engine size",sep=" "),
    subtitle = paste("Two seaters (sports cars) are an",
    "exception because of their light weight",sep=" "),
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov")
```

## Labels 

```{r}
p
```

## Labels

- As we learned last week, we can also modify the names of the axis titles and legend titles using the \texttt{labs()} function as well:

```{r}
p <- 
  p + labs(x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
           y="Highway Miles per Gallon",
           color = "Car Type")
```

## Labels 

```{r}
p
```

## Labels

- Sometimes, we need to add a mathematical symbol or equation to our graph in order to describe a graph. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, it is known that if we have sample data that come from a normal distribution, that the mean/expected value of the sample standard deviation, $s$, is biased.

$$ E[s] = \sigma\sqrt{\frac{2}{n-1}}\frac{\Gamma(n/2)}{\Gamma((n-1)/2)} $$

## Labels 

- For a large enough sample size, the bias goes away. Suppose we wanted to plot a function showing this phenomenon:

```{r}
sigma <- 5
n <- seq(2,100,by=1)
ev <- 5*sqrt(2/(n-1))*gamma(n/2)/gamma((n-1)/2)
p <- ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=n,y=ev),color="black") +
  geom_line(aes(x=n,y=sigma),color="red") +
  labs(x = "Sample Size",
       y = "Expected Value",
       title = expression(
         paste("Sample Standard Deviation ",
               "Is an Asymptotically Unbiased ",
               "Estimator of ",sigma)))
```

## Labels

```{r}
p
```

## Labels

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = runif(10),
             y = runif(10))
p <- df |> ggplot(aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs( 
    x = quote(sum(x[i]^2,i==1,n)),
    y = quote(alpha + beta + frac(delta,theta)))
```

## Labels 

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

- Having clear, effective labels for our axes, legends, and plot titles are important. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- There may be instances where we need to label individual observations or groups of observations. In \texttt{ggplot}-speak, these are referred to as \textit{annotations}.

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, with the \texttt{mpg} data, it might be effective to include the name of the most fuel efficient car in each of our car classes.

## Annotations

```{r}
label_info <- mpg |>
  group_by(drv) |>
  arrange(desc(displ)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1) |>
  mutate(
    drive_type = case_when(
      drv == "f" ~ "front-wheel drive",
      drv == "r" ~ "rear-wheel drive",
      drv == "4" ~ "4-wheel drive"
    )
  ) |>
  select(displ, hwy, drv, drive_type)
```

## Annotations 

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_text(
    data = label_info, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold", size = 5, hjust = "right", vjust = "bottom"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

- Okay, so this isn't very useful because some of the labels overlap with each other. To get around this, we can make use of functions within the \texttt{ggrepel} package. 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = label_info, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold", size = 5, nudge_y = 2
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

- Sometimes, instead of having a legend, it can be useful and more aesthetically pleasing to have data labels serve the same purpose as a legend.

\vskip 0.10 in

- Let's look at an example using the \texttt{penguins} dataframe. We know we could use:

```{r}
p <- palmerpenguins::penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=species))
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

```{r}
species_avg <- palmerpenguins::penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarize(
    bill_length_mm = median(bill_length_mm,na.rm=T),
    bill_depth_mm = median(bill_depth_mm,na.rm=T))

p <- palmerpenguins::penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm,color=species)) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label=species),
                            data=species_avg,
                            size = 6, label.size = 0,
                            segment.color = NA
                            ) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

- There are other instances when we want to put a single data label on a graph. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, maybe instead of our plot title explaining the graph, we include a brief explanation on the plot itself.

```{r}
label <- mpg |>
  summarize(
    displ = max(displ),
    hwy = max(hwy),
    label = paste(
      "Increasing engine size is \n related to",
      "decreasing fuel economy"
    )
  )
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = label),
    data = label,
    vjust = "top",
    hjust = "right"
  )
```

## Annotations

```{r}
p
```

## Annotations

```{r,echo=FALSE,out.height="75%",out.width="80%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("hjustvjust.jpg")
```

## Scales

- Another tool that can be handy for improving your graph is to modify the scales. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- Scales control things like the tick marks on the x and y axes. For all geoms, there are default scales that \texttt{ggplot} uses which correspond to the type of variable being used on the x and y axis.

## Scales

- So for example, when we plotted out:

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=class))
```

## Scales

- What \texttt{ggplot} is doing behind the scenes is:

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=class)) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_color_discrete()
```

## Scales

- Obviously, it's a nice feature that we don't have to type all that out every time, but there are times where we need to make changes to improve the quality of our graph.

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, there are lots of instances where we want to change our tick marks. Lete's say instead of our \texttt{hwy} tick marks being in increments of 10 starting at 20, we want them to be in increments of 5 starting at 15. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- Here, we can make an adjustment to the \texttt{scale\_y\_continuous} function to do just that.

## Scales

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15,40,by=5))
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```

## Scales

- There are other instances where we might need to repress the tick mark labels all together. I have found this be useful for plotting maps, but it could also be useful in cases where data is private, but you can still share the plot sans the data.

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL)
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```

## Scales

- In most of our examples, and probably in most cases, our tick mark labels are equally spaced. Sometimes, the data is better presented when the tick mark labels are unequally spaced.

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, suppose we wanted to show the years spanned by a particular president's time in office. The duration, in years, would be better explained if we had individual tick mark labels for the beginning and ending years of a presidency.

## Scales

```{r}
p <- presidential |>
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(start,id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_x_date(
    NULL,
    breaks = presidential$start,
    date_labels = "'%y"
  )
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```

## Scales

- Another aspect of a plot that we'll likely be in need of modifying at some point is the legend.

\vskip 0.10 in

- We already learned how to modify its title, but many times, we also need to modify its location on the plot, for whatever reason. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- We can move the legend to the top, bottom, left, or right of the plot in addition to supressing it using the \texttt{legend.position} argument inside of the the \texttt{theme()} function.

## Scales

```{r}
base <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
p1 <- base + theme(legend.position = "left")
p2 <- base + theme(legend.position = "top")
p3 <- base + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
p4 <- base + theme(legend.position = "right")
p5 <- base + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Scales

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
```

```{r}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,nrow=3)
```

## Scales

- We also have the ability to change characteristics of the legend itself using \texttt{guides}. 

\vskip 0.10 in

- By default, if we want our legend to be at the bottom of a graph, \texttt{ggplot} is breaking up our car types into two rows. But let's say we wanted just one row and we wanted those points to be a bit larger.

```{r}
p <- base + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(
    nrow = 1, override.aes = list(size = 4)
  ))
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```

## Scales

- Another scale that we will commonly want to modify is the color scale. As we've seen, \texttt{ggplot} has a default color scale for each geom.

\vskip 0.10 in

- However, there are a lot of instances where the default isn't appropriate. Fortunately, changing the color scale is not terribly complicated. We can check out different color scales available in the \texttt{RColorBrewer} package at \textit{colorbrewer2.org}.

\vskip 0.10 in

- For example, say we want our scale to be grayscale. Using the \texttt{scale\_color\_brewer()} function, we can change the default palette option to "greys." 

## Scales 

```{r}
p <- mpg |>
  ggplot(aes(displ,hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Greys")
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```

## Scales

- We can also manually specify the colors for a categorical variable. For example, let's say we wanted to add the traditional red and blue to our presidents graph to denote political affiliation.

```{r}
p <- presidential |>
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(start,id,color=party)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "red",
                                Democratic = "blue"))
```

## Scales

```{r}
p
```
